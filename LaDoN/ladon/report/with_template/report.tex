\begin{abstract}
	One of the most robust effects governing social life is homophily and triadic closure. We like people similar to ourselves, and we find new connections through our existing connections. These two effects can combine to self-reinforcing processes of shaping both social networks of social agents as well as their opinions. Here I investigate a stylized agent-based model of opinion dynamics. I find that the model can generate realistic social networks while simultaneously producing realistic opinion distributions.

\section{Theory}

One of the most robuts mechanisms governing social networks is the tendency of similarity to breed connection. 
This effect is often characterized as homophily. 
The effect of homophily results in neighbourhoods within social networks, which are homogeneous with regard to sociodemographic, behavioral and political characteristics. 
This has dramatic implications as one's social world defines what pieces of information, opinions and interactions that an individual have. 
The most clear example is echo chambers in social media networks. 
In echo chambers, homophily can lead to a distortion of what kind of information is presented to each individual. 

It is examples like those from echo chambers that clearly illustrates that the principles of homophily not only influences who we make connections with, but also how we think. 
Several studies have pointed to the fact that one's peer group is an important influence on one's behavior. 
For instance, shared political beliefs predict more behavioral involvement with one another.

Homophily and its effects become especially potent as they can create self-reinforcing mechanisms when combined with tie-formation principles such as triadic closure. 
Triadic closure refers to tie formation between "friends of friends" in a network. For instance, if $A \leftrightarrow B$ and $B \leftrightarrow C$, then this small system would achieve triadic closure by forming the edge $C \leftrightarrow A$. 
When new ties are found via triadic closure, 

To see why homophily and triadic closure can create self-reinforcing homophily effects, notice the following. Due to homophily, the probability of $A$ being similar to $B$ will be higher than
When they find new connections via triadic closure i.e. "friends of friends", 
In such cases, any social agent will have a protensity to like agents which are more similar to themselves. Moreover, they find new connections primarily by finding them via "friends of their friends". 

Homophily and its effects become especially potent when social agents can be influenced by their peers. 
This social influence can potentially explain how 

\subsection{Network Formation}

Here the presentation of the important characteristics of social networks should be included and why they come about. 
These include the high transitivity, clustering, communities, and exponential degree distributions.

\section{Figures and Tables}

Figures and Tables should be labeled and referenced in the standard way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

%\caption{Placeholder image of a Network with a long example caption to show justification setting.}

%\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:net} shows an example of how to insert a column-wide figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment. Figures wider than one column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide. Use \verb|\begin{SCfigure*}...\end{SCfigure*}| for a wide figure with side captions.

\subsection*{Tables}
In addition to including your tables within this manuscript file, PNAS requires that each table be uploaded to the submission separately as a “Table” file.  Please ensure that each table .tex file contains a preamble, the \verb|\begin{document}| command, and the \verb|\end{document}| command. This is necessary so that the submission system can convert each file to PDF.

\subsection*{Equations}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment mentioned above for figures. Using only \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| keeps the equation in a two collum format
